# Map of Coronavirus Testing Centers in LA County

Data taken from LA County Government website: https://corona-virus.la/testing-center-directory

# Motivations:

The main motivation behind this project was to make a one-stop-shop for locating coronavirus test centers. Many of my peers need proof of negative tests in order to board planes to fly back to China, and I wanted to make that process a little bit easier
